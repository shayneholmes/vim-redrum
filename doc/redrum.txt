Introduction                                               *redrum-introduction*

A novelty plugin that uses vim's |conceal| feature to show a buffer as if all
its non-whitespace characters were repetitions of the iconic phrase "All work
and no play makes Jack a dull boy" from "The Shining".

It is obviously of little utility.

Try inserting in a document with this plugin enabled: The experience of typing
out your own words, only to see them come out as if you're Jack Nicholson (or
Jack Torrance), is disorienting and mildly entertaining.

Note: This plugin doesn't actually change any buffer's contents, merely how
they're shown.

==============================================================================
Commands and usage

:Redrum                                                              *:Redrum*

  Toggle redrum on and off.

:Redrum!

  Turn redrum off.

==============================================================================
Options                                                         *redrum-options*

Options don't immediately take effect: If you change an option while redrum is
on, you'll need to turn redrum off and on again to see any change.

Options can be configured for an individual buffer by prefixing them with |b:|
instead of |g:|.

g:redrum_message                                              *g:redrum_message*
                                                              *b:redrum_message*
  Type: |String|
  Default: `'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.'`

  This is the message that will repeat over and over again, in the shape of
  your text. Some alternatives: >

    " Lorem ipsum
    let g:redrum_message = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing
      \ elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor. Aenean massa. Cum sociis
      \ natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus
      \ mus. Donec quam felis, ultricies nec, pellentesque eu, pretium quis,
      \ sem. Nulla consequat massa quis enim. Donec pede justo, fringilla vel,
      \ aliquet nec, vulputate eget, arcu. In enim justo, rhoncus ut,
      \ imperdiet a, venenatis vitae, justo. '

    " Metasyntatic variable soup
    let g:redrum_message = 'foo bar quuz corge quux foo quuz garply bar qux
      \ waldo foo quuz grault bar fred thud quuz bar thud garply plugh bar
      \ garply xyzzy corge garply waldo quux quuz '
<
g:redrum_match_pattern                                  *g:redrum_match_pattern*
                                                        *b:redrum_match_pattern*
  Type: |String| (see |:syn-pattern|)
  Default: `'"."'`

  A match of this pattern in your buffer will be replaced by a character in
  the redrum_message.

  Some alternatives:>

    " Only replace non-whitespace characters
    let g:redrum_match_pattern = '"\w"'
<
g:redrum_skip_pattern                                    *g:redrum_skip_pattern*
                                                         *b:redrum_skip_pattern*
  Type: |String| (see |:syn-pattern|)
  Default: `'"^\s*\|\s\{4,}"'

  A match of this pattern in your buffer will display as usual, and the next
  match of match_pattern will be replaced with next non-blank character of the
  message.

  If something in your document isn't matched by this pattern or
  match_pattern, the message will reset at the next match_pattern.

  Some alternatives:>

    " Leave all whitespace alone
    let g:redrum_skip_pattern = '"\s"'
<
